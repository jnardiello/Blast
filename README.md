# Not under active development
This was my **very first** personal project and dates back to 2013. It is not anymore maintained.

## Blast framework

**Blast** is a PHP framework that aims to provide few functionalities (such as a Markdown Based Blogging engine and an Auth login routine). It is carefully crafted and i'm trying to ship the best code possible. All main functionalities are tested but i consider it still as an early Alpha, i therefore don't recommend using it in production or for large systems.

##Modules
The system is designed to dynamically load user-generated modules, which include and implement functionalities for the system.

##Documentation
If you are interested in understanding how to create a Module please refer to the `/doc/` folder, it should be enough to get your started.

##Disclaimer and who is this for
**Blast** is a really basic framework. It isn't a well-packed fat framework, providing loads of functionalities and using a mind-twisting logic. It's inteded for really fast development and the framework is aimed to be a container for user-designed-modules. Using frameworks as CakePHP or Symfony for personal projects is a bit like using a Bazooka to kill flies.  
  
This is what **Blast** is supposed for: make life easier on quick projects and let you focus on your module design.
